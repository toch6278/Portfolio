        <h3> Project 1 - Expressive Booklet </h3>
        <p> With this project, the students were to take a section of a song or poem and display the lyrics in a typographic way,
        utilizing 3 spot colors, and incorporating the tone we chose in our mood board. </p>
        <p> The song I chose for this project is "We Won't be Different Alone" by Switch

        <h3> Project 2 - Poster Mailer </h3>
        <p> With this project, the students were given the task to create a poster for the Colorado Symphony
        and the performances that will be presented during the event.</p>
        <p> The idea behind my poster design was to encapsulate the idea of a timelapse of light at night, similar to a busy street
        full of cars at night. </p>

        <h3> Project 3 - Personal Packaging </h3>
        <p> For the packaging project, students first needed to create their own personal logotype from a lab assignment.
        Then for the final project, the students were given the task to display content that consisted of information
        about who the individual student is as a person in the form of a package design.</p>
        <p> The product I decided to design for is chai tea since chai is my favorite beverage. The tone I ideated with is a calm,
        fancy, serene feeling, which brought forth the results of a teal and gold color and a Chinese tea house feeling </p>

        <h3> Project 4 - Web AR </h3>
        <p> With this project, the students were to create a virtual world pulling in 3D objects and programming how objects
        are displayed and the different equirectangular environments displayed in augmented reality </p>
      </div>
      <div class="modal">
        <h3> Project 5 - Animation Project </h3>
        <p> In this project, the students were given the task to tell a story by creating an animation using Timeline Video animation
        in Adobe Photoshop </p>
        <p> The idea I had behind this animation was a student who bought a book from a book store. The student didn't know it could fly.
        So, as the book started flying away, the student made their best effort to retrieve the book back. Once the student reaches the top
        of the tree, it finds the book just lounging on a chair </p>
