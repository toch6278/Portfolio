        <p> <strong> Name: </strong> Torshawna Chew </p>
        <p> <strong> University: </strong> University of Colorado Boulder </p>
        <p> <strong> High School: </strong> Niwot High School </p>
        <p> Torshawna Chew is a hardworking and diligent worker who employs to present the best work she can in a given period of time. Torshawna is motivated by her community and surroundings, is willing to learn new skills and best practices, expand and collaborate with others on different ideas and practices great communication skills with her group. </p>
        <p> <strong> Accreditation: </strong> I decided to pursue a degree in Creative Technology and Design with a focus on developing knowledge in graphic design and web development because I enjoy working with technology but also being able to display new innovations in an artistic way to enhance a users interaction and experience with the product.
        I originally decided to pursue this major is because I participated in my local robotics team in high school <em> (FIRST Robotics) </em>, designing and fabricating robot parts using Solidworks, then assembling the parts created to create our full robot to compete in competitions. I really enjoyed being able to design mechanisms and parts alongside my mentors
        that was robust, easily accessible, and also a unique design compared to a typical robot. One of my mentors noticed that I really enjoyed making art as well and introduced me to this program at CU Boulder. She told me that her sons also pursued this discipline and are now game designers, so I decided to read through the description of this major.
        After reading through what the program was about and the classes that they offered, I was immediately interested, knew that this was what I wanted to have a career in the future. </p>
